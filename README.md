This program encrypts using AES (and it has GUI :). I beleive that the way I wrote this is an incorrect use of cyphering. But it's the effort that counts right?

Note that the option "settings" also exits the program.

Btw: This is probably not a legit encryption program. [insert legal stuff here] In short use this code at your own risk (mainly for fun) and I'm not liable if your secrets get exposed.
